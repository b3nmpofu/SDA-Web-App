                  The Seventh-day Adventist Church houses a number
                  of departments that cater to the global needs
                  of the denomination. The overall goal of all these entities
                   is to make good on the Adventist promise to help everyone
                   understand the Bible and find freedom, healing and hope in Jesus.

                  Children’s Ministries mission is about developing resources that foster the faith of children, aged from birth through to fourteen, to make them disciples.   Children’s Ministries department looks and works to equip churches, families, and every other person that may have any spiritual influence on the children, with resources and trainings to connect children to a lifelong, loving relationship with Jesus. To get such goals CHM seeks to provide ideas and activities for parents and their children that will lead them to Jesus and disciple them in their daily walk with Him. Our main wish is that every child may encounter Jesus as personal Saviour and best Friend.
