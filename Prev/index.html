    The inhabitants of Canaan were given to idolatry, and God had forbidden
  intermarriage between His people and them, knowing that such marriages would
  lead to apostasy. The patriarch feared the effect of the corrupting influences surrounding
   his son. Abraham’s habitual faith in God and submission to His will were reflected in the
   character of Isaac; but the young man’s affections were strong, and he was gentle and
  yielding in disposition. If united with one who did not fear God, he would be in danger
  of sacrificing principle for the sake of harmony. In the mind of Abraham the choice of
  a wife for his son was a matter of grave importance; he was anxious to have him
  marry one who would not lead him from God. Patriarchs and Prophets p171.1
