      <p>Sabbath School (Church at Study) is a time where we can come together to discuss what we have learned about God through our daily study of the Bible providing a sense of fellowship and community.

      The Sabbath School programme starts at 9.30am on Saturdays and finishes at 10.45. There are different classes for different age groups including children, teens and youth and multiple different adult classes. You can choose which class you want to attend.

      One of the main functions of the Sabbath School is to provide a mission emphasis that reaches out into the wider world. Special projects are selected by the international Church to be the beneficiaries of funds that will allow development of hospitals, colleges, schools and churches.</p>

              <h2>Realtime Faith</h2>
              <p> Real-Time Faith is the Sabbath School Bible Study Guide designed for Earliteens,ages 13 – 14, and created by the Sabbath School department at the General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The lessons are designed for Earliteens to incorporate in their daily Bible study. The lessons provide the basis for learning and discussion in the Earliteen Sabbath School class.

The emphasis of this curriculum is God’s kingdom of grace, being a recruited agent (steward, citizen) of that kingdom, and the battle between it and the kingdom of evil. Being in God’s kingdom requires action—being doers and not just listeners (James 1:22) of how to live as God’s agents on this earth.

The first lesson of each quarter of the two-year cycle is a different portion of the Sermon on the Mount, which is “at once Christ’s inaugural address as King of the kingdom of grace and also the constitution of the kingdom” (Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, 2nd ed., vol. 5, p. 322).

After the first lesson of each quarter, each of the other twelve lessons (or sets of lessons) is about a different challenge, right, or privilege in the “real time” of being an agent of God’s kingdom.</p>
